Keywords:  Soccer Team Selection, Player Analysis, Python

Description: 
As we know that statistical and predictive analytics has got the attention among all the industries to help the stakeholders to plan their business. At the same time, many sports companies are also using it to understand the different patterns (like goal scoring pattern of a player) and helping the owners to plan their club business accordingly.
In this project, I will be working on the soccer attributes(skills) data related to different players across the world (mostly from European leagues).
In the generated dataset, attributes have been rated based on player’s performance in the range of 0-100. This project will mainly focus on the minimizing the time to select a player based on factors like its cost and other attributes. The data will be of quantitative type mostly discrete data. All analysis and visualization will be done using Python libraries.

There are multiple questions that can be asked but few are mentioned below:

1.	Which club team is the most valuable in the Europe?
2.	Which are best young players for each position?
3.	How different soccer skills are correlated to each other for players of different positions?
4.	Which player is best fit to play at a particular position in case of any injury to first team player?
5.	Comparing different countries/leagues based on different attributes.

Intellectual Merit: 
In this as we are getting multiple insights from the data but the new knowledge, we can get more using predictive analytics. 

1)	Minimum rating of each skill required for a player to be part of first team (at different positions).
2)	Deciding the length of contract to be given to a player after the expiration of current one.
3)	Deciding the future transfers based on club’s budget and player’s performance.

Data Sourcing:  
For this project, the primary source of data will be CSV data which is readily available to download prepared by the FIFA (regulatory federation for International and Club Soccer), which is considered most trusted data. Apart from this, web scraping can be done from different external websites to explore more data, if required for further analysis.
