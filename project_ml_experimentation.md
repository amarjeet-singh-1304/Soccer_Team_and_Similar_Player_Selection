Above shows the raw record but the below shows the data/attributes used in the model training and
prediction

'potential','club_position', 'pace', 'shooting', 'passing', 'dribbling', 'defending', 'physic','attacking_crossing', 'attacking_finishing','attacking_heading_accuracy', 'attacking_short_passing', 'attacking_volleys', 'skill_dribbling','skill_curve','skill_fk_accuracy', 'skill_long_passing', 'skill_ball_control', 'movement_acceleration','movement_sprint_speed','movement_agility', 'movement_reactions', 'movement_balance', 'power_shot_power', 'power_jumping','power_stamina','power_strength', 'power_long_shots', 'mentality_aggression', 'mentality_interceptions','mentality_positioning', 'mentality_vision', 'mentality_penalties', 'mentality_composure','defending_marking_awareness','defending_standing_tackle', 'defending_sliding_tackle', 'goalkeeping_diving','goalkeeping_handling', 'goalkeeping_kicking','goalkeeping_positioning', 'goalkeeping_reflexes', 'goalkeeping_speed', 'preferred_foot','weak_foot','age', 'height_cm', 'weight_kg', 'year'

Prediction Explanation: 
The ratings has been processed on the basis of club position(playing position means defense, midfielder, forward) 
and skills that are taken to build the model. The model has predicted has overall value 91. Here the
players has position has playing position of Centre Forward and attributes like attacking_shooting,
pace and shooting has higher values so the overall value is also high. So the model is predicting 
rightly based on the other attributes value.

Prediction Explanation:** 
As the above-mentioned record is of defensive player(i.e. Centre Back) and attributes like defending, physic,
skill_long_passing, passing, defending_standing_tackle, defending_sliding_tackle impact the overall rating.
So the above record is having less rating for these attributes so the model predicted the lower overall rating 
i.e. 55 and there is still marginal error than the actual rating i.e. 58

## Interesting Features
### Feature A
**Feature:** 
Movement Reaction

**Justification:** 
The Movement reaction is an important feature with respect to any field game not only for soccer.
The rating of this attribute is given based on the reaction time of any player after any situation,
means how much quickly a soccer player behaves after loosing a ball or for a goalkeeper, how he
reacts after an outfield players hits a shot. So according to domain knowledge, it is an important
attribute for any player

### Feature B
**Feature:** 
Passing

**Justification:** 
As, we all know that soccer is a team game and every team tries to score opposition goal by passing
the ball to their team player.As per domain knowledge passing is another  most important attribute 
which can impact the player's overall rating. Here the value of passing is calculated based on number
of passes completed divided by total number of passes a player attempted * 100. 

## Experiments 
### Varying A
**Prediction Trend Seen:** 
As, it has been mentioned above that it is an important attribute for any player so this attribute
shows a direct relationship with the overall rating, means that increase in this attribute rating
increases the overall rating and on other side, a decrease in this attribute rating decreases the 
overall rating.

### Varying B
**Prediction Trend Seen:**
This attribute (passing) also shows direct relationship with the overall rating. Means increase in
value of passing increases the overall rating and a decrease will decrease the overall rating.
Therefore, the model on given dataset shows expected behaviour. 

### Varying A and B together
**Prediction Trend Seen:** 
Based on above two trends, it can be said together increasing the both attributes will increase 
the overall rating and decreasing both will decrease the overall value. Also, the experimentation
showed this behavior. Also, the slope of trend graph is more than that of above two trends.


### Varying A and B inversely
**Prediction Trend Seen:** 
Here, 2 cases are checked. In the first case, while increasing the passing value and decreasing the 
movement_reaction (by almost same percentage).It was found that the overall value of rating is increased
slightly (not as it was increased while increasing the passing value only). In the other case,
when passing value was increased and movement_reaction was decreased, the overall rating was
decreased slightly.This shows that change in movement reaction is impacting the overall rating
more than that of passing value.
